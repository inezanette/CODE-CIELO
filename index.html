										<h2>3 Components We Use To Get Results:</h2>
										<h3 class="services">1. Traffice</h3>
										<p> First, we put your business in front of people actively looking for you right now. This covers both paid and organic visibility, starting with optimizing your Google Business Profile to improve your ranking on Google and to build social proof with the reviews we help you get.</p>
										<h3 class="services">2. Leads</h3>
										<p> The second step is to pull leads from all the traffic you're now getting. We use email opt-in lead magnets to capture your visitors email addresses so you can continue to nurture your leads into paying customers even after they leave your website.</p>
										<h3 class="services">3. Clients</h3>
										<p> The third step is converting your leads into clients. We optimize your client onboarding process to make it as fast and easy as possible for your leads to take the next step toward hiring you. Because we have already laid the groundwork with steps #1 and #2, your leads are well-qualified and better educated, making your sales cycle quick and easy.

            <p class="bio">My name is Inez Solis, and I founded CODE CIELO specifically to help business professionals land local clients without feeling like they're gambling their money with web agencies who know how to create websites, but not how to get results from the websites.</p>
                </br>
            <p class="bio">As a business owner myself, I know that it is important to get fast results. I also know that you don't have the time to worry about figuring out what to say on your website, what to share on social media, and how to leverage all the latest online marketing trends. So, we take care of everything for you.</p>
